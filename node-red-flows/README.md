All of these flows were created using the "export flow" feature in Node-Red in order to make them readable in Github. They are not the actual running flows,
because that file is generated in Node-Red to one MASSIVE single line file, difficult for Versioning and readablity on github. 

As such they match live only as often as I remeber to update them.
